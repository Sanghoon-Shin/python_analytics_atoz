Introductory Notebooks for Data Analytics using Python/Pandas/Other libraries.
There are nine sessions after studying you can understand/use python-based data analytics.
Please note that there are some korean - my mother tongue - descriptions included.

To open the notebook, you need to setup your own Jupyter environment.
The easiest and suggested way is installing Anacona pacakge.
Please refer the anaconda web page (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) and 
install the package and start a jupyter environment - jupyter notebook or jupyter lab.

After then, you can download (or clone) this Github into your local machine.
If you know how to use Git, then please clone this project to your Jupyter ntoebook directory.
Otherwise, download this project as a zip file, and deflate the file into your Jupyter notebook directory.
